Feature: Discharge Follow-up
  As a patient care coordinator
  I want automated follow-up scheduling and patient communication after discharge
  So that patients receive proper continuity of care and adhere to treatment plans

  Background:
    Given the ED management system is operational
    And the patient portal is connected and functional
    And the follow-up scheduling module is active
    And automated reminder systems are enabled
    And patient communication preferences are configured

  Scenario: Automatically schedule follow-up reminder for primary care
    Given a patient "Jennifer Martinez" has been discharged from bed "ED-8"
    And the discharge orders include:
      | Follow-up Requirement | Details                                    |
      | Primary Care Visit    | Schedule within 3-5 days                  |
      | Reason for Follow-up  | UTI treatment response, medication review  |
      | Urgency Level         | Routine                                    |
      | Special Instructions  | Bring discharge paperwork and medication list |
    And the patient has a registered primary care physician "Dr. Sarah Wilson"
    When the discharge process is completed at 14:30
    Then the system automatically schedules a follow-up reminder:
      | Reminder Type         | Details                                    |
      | Initial Reminder      | Day 2 after discharge (in 48 hours)      |
      | Follow-up Reminder    | Day 4 after discharge if no appointment   |
      | Final Reminder        | Day 6 after discharge (urgent)           |
      | Reminder Methods      | Text, email, phone call                   |
    And discharge instructions are automatically sent to the patient portal:
      | Portal Section        | Content Delivered                          |
      | Discharge Summary     | Complete treatment summary and diagnosis   |
      | Medication Instructions| Prescription details and dosing schedule |
      | Follow-up Requirements| Primary care appointment needed in 3-5 days|
      | Return Precautions    | When to seek emergency care               |
      | Care Instructions     | Home care guidelines and activity restrictions|
    And the patient receives immediate portal notification:
      | Notification Type     | Content                                    |
      | Portal Alert          | ðŸ“‹ New discharge instructions available   |
      | Text Message          | "ED discharge complete. Check patient portal for instructions" |
      | Email Notification    | Detailed discharge summary with portal link|

  Scenario: Handle follow-up scheduling with multiple appointment types
    Given a patient "Robert Chen" is discharged with complex follow-up needs
    And the discharge orders specify:
      | Follow-up Type        | Timeframe | Provider Type     | Priority  |
      | Primary Care         | 3 days    | Family Medicine   | High      |
      | Cardiology Consult   | 1 week    | Cardiologist      | Urgent    |
      | Lab Work Follow-up   | 5 days    | Lab/Primary Care  | Routine   |
      | Physical Therapy     | 2 weeks   | PT Specialist     | Routine   |
    When the discharge process is completed
