Feature: Patient Discharge
  As a physician
  I want to efficiently process patient discharges with automated documentation and workflow
  So that patients receive proper instructions and departmental processes are streamlined

  Background:
    Given the ED management system is operational
    And I am logged in as "Dr. Johnson"
    And the discharge module is active
    And billing integration is enabled
    And bed management system is connected

  Scenario: Complete standard patient discharge with instructions
    Given a patient "Jennifer Martinez" is in bed "ED-8"
    And the patient has completed treatment for "urinary tract infection"
    And all diagnostic tests and treatments are finished
    And the patient is medically stable for discharge
    When I enter discharge orders and instructions:
      | Order Type         | Details                                      |
      | Discharge Status   | Home with medications                        |
      | Primary Diagnosis  | Urinary tract infection (N39.0)             |

      | Return Precautions | Fever >101Â°F, worsening symptoms, blood in urine |
    And I submit the discharge orders
    Then the system generates comprehensive discharge paperwork:

      | Return Precautions | When to seek emergency care                  |
      | Patient Education  | UTI prevention and care instructions         |
    And the system updates bed availability:

    And shift change occurs at 19:00
    And "Dr. Day" (day shift) is discharging the patient
    And "Dr. Night" (evening shift) is incoming
    When "Dr. Day" enters the discharge orders
    And the discharge process extends past shift change
    Then the system manages the transition seamlessly:

      | Dr. Day   | Discharge completed for Lisa Brown            |
      | Dr. Night | Lisa Brown discharged - available for questions|

    Given multiple patients are ready for simultaneous discharge:
      | Patient Name    | Bed    | Diagnosis        | Discharge Type     |
      | Patient A       | ED-3   | Minor injury     | Home              |
      | Patient B       | ED-7   | Gastroenteritis  | Home with meds    |
      | Patient C       | ED-11  | Anxiety          | Home with referral |
