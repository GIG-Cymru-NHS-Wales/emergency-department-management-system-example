Feature: Performance Metrics
  As an ED manager
  I want to generate comprehensive monthly performance reports
  So that I can evaluate departmental efficiency, quality of care, and identify improvement opportunities

  Background:
    Given the ED management system is operational
    And I am logged in as "ED Manager Thompson"
    And the reporting module has access to historical data
    And the performance metrics calculation engine is enabled
    And patient satisfaction data is integrated from survey systems

  Scenario: Generate comprehensive monthly performance report
    Given it is the first day of the new month
    And I need to review performance data for the previous month (May 2025)
    And the system has collected data from May 1-31, 2025
    When I run the monthly performance report for May 2025
    Then the system generates comprehensive metrics including:
      | Core Metric Category  | Key Performance Indicators                |
      | Length of Stay        | Average, median, 95th percentile by ESI   |
      | LWBS Rates           | Left without being seen percentages        |
      | Patient Satisfaction  | Overall scores and domain-specific ratings |
      | Throughput Metrics   | Door-to-provider, bed turnaround times     |
      | Quality Indicators   | Safety events, readmission rates          |
    And the average length of stay metrics show:
      | ESI Level            | Average LOS | Target LOS | Variance     |
      | ESI 1 (Critical)     | 180 minutes | 240 minutes| -25% (Good)  |
      | ESI 2 (High Priority)| 165 minutes | 180 minutes| -8% (Good)   |
      | ESI 3 (Urgent)       | 145 minutes | 150 minutes| -3% (Good)   |
      | ESI 4 (Less Urgent)  | 95 minutes  | 120 minutes| -21% (Good)  |
      | ESI 5 (Non-urgent)   | 75 minutes  | 90 minutes | -17% (Good)  |
      | Overall Average      | 132 minutes | 156 minutes| -15% (Good)  |
    And left without being seen (LWBS) rates are calculated:
      | LWBS Metric          | May 2025    | Target     | Status       |
      | Overall LWBS Rate    | 3.2%        | <5%        | Meeting target|
      | ESI 3 LWBS Rate      | 4.1%        | <6%        | Meeting target|
      | ESI 4 LWBS Rate      | 5.8%        | <8%        | Meeting target|
      | ESI 5 LWBS Rate      | 8.2%        | <12%       | Meeting target|
      | Peak Hours LWBS      | 6.1%        | <8%        | Meeting target|
    And patient satisfaction scores are displayed:
      | Satisfaction Domain  | May Score   | Target     | Trend vs April|
