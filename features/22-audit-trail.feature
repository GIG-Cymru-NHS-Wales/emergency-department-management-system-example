Feature: Audit Trail
  As a compliance officer
  I want to review comprehensive access logs for patient records
  So that I can ensure HIPAA compliance and investigate any unauthorized access to protected health information

  Background:
    Given the ED management system is operational
    And I am logged in as "Compliance Officer Martinez"
    And the audit logging system is active and capturing all access events
    And patient record access is being monitored in real-time
    And audit reports are available for compliance review

  Scenario: Review comprehensive access log for frequently accessed patient record
    Given a patient "Jennifer Rodriguez" was treated in the ED on June 20, 2025
    And her medical record number is "MRN-789456"
    And multiple healthcare providers accessed her record during and after her visit
    When I search for access logs for patient "Jennifer Rodriguez" (MRN-789456)
    And I set the date range from June 20-24, 2025
    And I generate the comprehensive audit report
    Then the system displays all users who accessed the record:
      | Access # | User Name          | User Role           | Department       | Access Purpose    |
      | 1        | Dr. Sarah Kim      | Emergency Physician | Emergency Dept   | Direct patient care|
      | 2        | Nurse Johnson      | Registered Nurse    | Emergency Dept   | Direct patient care|
      | 3        | Tech Martinez      | Lab Technician      | Laboratory       | Lab result entry  |
      | 4        | Dr. Chen           | Radiologist         | Radiology        | Image interpretation|

      | 7        | Dr. Patel          | Cardiologist        | Cardiology       | Consultation      |
    And detailed timestamps are shown for each access:
      | User Name          | Login Time           | Logout Time          | Session Duration |
      | Dr. Sarah Kim      | 2025-06-20 14:15:22 | 2025-06-20 14:45:10 | 29 min 48 sec   |
      | Nurse Johnson      | 2025-06-20 14:20:15 | 2025-06-20 16:30:22 | 2 hr 10 min 7 sec|

      | Billing Clerk Adams| 2025-06-21 09:15:20 | 2025-06-21 09:22:15 | 6 min 55 sec    |
      | Case Mgr Wilson    | 2025-06-21 11:30:10 | 2025-06-21 11:45:33 | 15 min 23 sec   |
      | Dr. Patel          | 2025-06-22 10:22:18 | 2025-06-22 10:35:45 | 13 min 27 sec   |
    And specific data elements accessed are documented:
      | User Name          | Data Elements Accessed                           | Actions Performed        |
      | Dr. Sarah Kim      | Demographics, Chief complaint, Vital signs, Assessment, Orders | View, Edit, Create    |

      | Dr. Patel          | Cardiac tests, Consultation notes              | View, Create notes     |

  Scenario: Investigate suspicious access pattern for patient record
    Given a patient "Robert Thompson" has a high-profile status
    And there have been unusual access patterns to his record
    And the patient was not treated in the hospital during the access period
    When I generate a detailed audit report for "Robert Thompson" (MRN-456789)
    And I focus on the suspicious access period from June 15-18, 2025
    Then the system identifies potentially inappropriate access:
      | Suspicious Activity | Details                                          |
      | Unauthorized User   | Dr. Williams (Orthopedics) - No treatment relationship|
      | Unusual Timing      | Access at 11:45 PM on June 16 (outside normal hours)|
      | Excessive Duration  | 45-minute session for patient not under care    |
      | Data Mining Pattern | Accessed multiple unrelated patient records same night|
    And detailed forensic information is provided:
      | Forensic Data       | Investigation Details                            |
      | IP Address          | 192.168.1.205 (Dr. Williams' office computer)  |
      | Workstation ID      | WS-ORTHO-03                                     |
      | Access Method       | Valid credentials, no badge scan               |
      | Previous Pattern    | First time accessing this patient               |
      | Concurrent Activity | Accessed 8 other unrelated patients same session|
    And compliance violation indicators are flagged:
      | Violation Type      | HIPAA Concern                                   |
      | No Treatment Relationship| No medical necessity for access              |
      | Excessive Access    | Viewed entire medical history unnecessarily    |
      | Pattern of Behavior | Multiple inappropriate accesses detected       |
      | Time-based Concern  | Access outside normal work hours              |
    And automatic security alerts are generated:
      | Alert Type          | Notification Details                            |
      | Privacy Officer     | Immediate alert sent for investigation          |

      | Risk Management     | Potential HIPAA violation logged              |

  Scenario: Generate audit report for break-the-glass emergency access
    Given a patient "Emergency John Doe" was brought unconscious to the ED
    And normal consent procedures could not be followed due to patient condition
    And emergency "break-the-glass" access was used to view records
    When I review the emergency access audit trail
    Then the system documents the break-the-glass access:
      | Emergency Access    | Documentation                                   |
      | Access Type         | Break-the-glass emergency override             |
      | Medical Justification| Patient unconscious, life-threatening condition|
      | Authorizing Physician| Dr. Emergency Chief (Emergency Department Head) |
      | Access Duration     | 2 hours during critical care period           |
      | Override Reason     | Unable to obtain consent, medical emergency    |
    And all emergency access activities are logged:
      | Activity            | Details                                         |
      | Records Accessed    | Previous ED visits, medication allergies, medical history|
      | Users Involved      | Dr. Sarah Kim, Nurse Johnson, Pharmacist Lee   |

      | Clinical Decisions  | Medication choices based on allergy history    |
      | Patient Outcome     | Successful treatment, patient stabilized       |
    And post-emergency review requirements are documented:
      | Review Requirement  | Compliance Action                               |
      | Medical Necessity   | Clinical justification documented              |
      | Minimum Necessary   | Only essential health information accessed     |
      | Patient Notification| Patient to be informed of emergency access when able|
      | Quality Review      | Emergency access appropriateness reviewed      |

  Scenario: Audit trail for patient who requested access log of their own record
    Given a patient "Maria Santos" has requested a copy of her access log
    And this is her legal right under HIPAA
    And she was treated on multiple occasions in the past year
    When I generate a patient-facing access report for "Maria Santos" (MRN-321654)
    And I include the past 12 months of access activity
    Then the system creates a patient-appropriate access summary:
      | Access Summary      | Patient-Friendly Information                    |
      | Healthcare Providers| Names and roles of providers who accessed record|

  Scenario: Monthly compliance audit report for department oversight
    Given it is the first week of July 2025
    And I need to generate the monthly compliance report for June
    When I run the comprehensive monthly audit analysis
    Then the system provides departmental access statistics:
      | Access Metric       | June 2025 Statistics                           |
      | Total Record Access | 15,847 patient record accesses                |
