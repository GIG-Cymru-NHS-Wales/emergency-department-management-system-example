Feature: Real-time Dashboard
  As a charge nurse
  I want to monitor real-time department status through a comprehensive dashboard
  So that I can make informed decisions about patient flow, staffing, and resource allocation

  Background:
    Given the ED management system is operational
    And I am logged in as "Charge Nurse Williams"
    And the real-time dashboard module is active
    And automatic data refresh is enabled at 30-second intervals
    And all data sources are connected and synchronized

  Scenario: Display comprehensive department status on main dashboard
    Given it is 14:30 on a busy Tuesday afternoon
    And the ED has the following current status:
      | Metric Type           | Current Value  | Capacity/Target |
      | Total Patient Census  | 18 patients    | 20 bed capacity |
      | Patients Waiting      | 12 patients    | Target <8       |
      | Occupied Beds         | 16 beds        | 20 total beds   |
      | Available Beds        | 2 beds         | 4 beds clean    |
      | Beds Needing Cleaning | 2 beds         | Standard process|
    When I access the main dashboard
    Then the system displays the current patient census:
      | Census Information    | Display Details                            |
      | Total Patients        | 18 (90% capacity) - Yellow indicator      |
      | Admitted Patients     | 14 currently in beds                       |
      | Waiting Patients      | 12 in triage queue - Red alert            |
      | Discharged Today      | 23 patients processed                      |
    And the system shows average wait times:
      | Wait Time Category    | Current Average | Target Time    | Status    |
      | Triage to Bed         | 45 minutes     | <30 minutes    | Over target|
      | Bed to Provider       | 25 minutes     | <15 minutes    | Over target|
      | Provider to Discharge | 120 minutes    | <90 minutes    | Over target|
      | Total ED Length of Stay| 190 minutes   | <240 minutes   | On target |
    And bed availability is displayed with visual indicators:
      | Bed Status            | Count | Visual Indicator                           |
      | Available Clean       | 2     | ðŸŸ¢ Green beds ready for patients          |
      | Needs Cleaning        | 2     | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow beds awaiting housekeeping      |
      | Occupied              | 16    | ðŸ”´ Red beds with current patients          |
      | Out of Service        | 0     | âš« Black beds unavailable                 |
    And staff assignments are shown in real-time:
      | Staff Role            | Current Assignment | Status/Location           |
      | Dr. Smith             | 3 patients         | Available for new patient |
      | Dr. Johnson           | 4 patients         | At capacity               |
      | Nurse Martinez        | 5 patients         | High workload             |
      | Nurse Chen            | 4 patients         | Normal workload           |

  Scenario: Monitor real-time updates with 30-second refresh cycle
    Given the dashboard is displaying current data at 15:00:00
    And automatic refresh is set to 30-second intervals
    When 30 seconds elapse and new data becomes available:
      | Data Change           | Previous Value | New Value      | Change Type |
      | Patient Census        | 18 patients    | 19 patients    | Increase    |
      | Available Beds        | 2 beds         | 1 bed          | Decrease    |
      | Average Triage Wait   | 45 minutes     | 50 minutes     | Increase    |
      | Dr. Smith Availability| Available      | Busy           | Status change|
    Then the dashboard automatically updates at 15:00:30:
      | Updated Metric        | New Display                                |
      | Patient Count         | 19 (95% capacity) - Red indicator         |
      | Bed Availability      | 1 available - Critical level alert        |
      | Wait Time Alert       | Triage wait exceeds 45 min threshold      |
      | Staff Status          | Dr. Smith now unavailable                 |
    And visual indicators reflect the changes:
      | Visual Update         | Change Description                         |
      | Capacity Indicator    | Yellow â†’ Red (approaching full capacity)   |
      | Bed Status Alert      | New warning for low bed availability       |
      | Provider Icon         | Dr. Smith icon changes to "busy" status   |
    And the last update timestamp shows "Updated: 15:00:30"
    And critical alerts are highlighted with flashing indicators

  Scenario: Display priority alerts and notifications on dashboard
    Given the dashboard is actively monitoring department status
    When critical conditions occur requiring immediate attention:
      | Alert Type            | Trigger Condition                          |
      | Capacity Alert        | >95% bed occupancy reached                 |
      | Wait Time Alert       | Triage wait time >60 minutes              |
      | Critical Patient      | ESI Level 1 patient in queue              |
      | Staffing Alert        | Provider-to-patient ratio exceeded        |
    Then the dashboard displays prominent alert notifications:
      | Alert Priority        | Visual Display                             |
      | CRITICAL              | ðŸš¨ Red flashing banner at top of screen   |
