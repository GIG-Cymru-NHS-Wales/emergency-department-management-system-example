Feature: Code Blue Response
  As a nurse
  I want to rapidly activate emergency response for cardiac arrest patients
  So that the code team can respond immediately with proper coordination and documentation

  Background:
    Given the ED management system is operational
    And the code blue alert system is active
    And the resuscitation documentation module is enabled
    And all display devices are connected to the alert network
    And the code team roster is current and available

  Scenario: Activate code blue for cardiac arrest in bed 5
    Given a patient "Robert Martinez" is in bed "ED-5"
    And the patient is being monitored for chest pain
    And I am "Nurse Johnson" providing direct patient care
    When the patient suddenly becomes unresponsive and pulseless
    And I immediately press the code blue button at bedside
    Then the system instantly activates the code blue alert:
      | Alert Component       | Activation Details                         |
      | Alert Timestamp       | 14:35:22 - Precise time recorded          |
      | Location              | ED-5 clearly identified                   |
      | Initiating Staff      | Nurse Johnson                             |
      | Patient Identity      | Robert Martinez (if available)            |
      | Alert Type            | Code Blue - Cardiac Arrest                |
    And the code team is immediately alerted through multiple channels:
      | Team Member           | Alert Method          | Expected Response Time |
      | Emergency Physician   | Overhead page, mobile | Immediate             |
      | Cardiologist         | Mobile alert, pager   | Within 2 minutes      |
      | Anesthesiologist     | Overhead page, mobile | Within 3 minutes      |
      | ICU Nurse            | Mobile alert, pager   | Within 2 minutes      |
      | Respiratory Therapist | Overhead page, mobile | Within 2 minutes      |
      | Pharmacist           | Mobile alert          | Within 3 minutes      |
      | Chaplain             | Silent alert          | Within 5 minutes      |
    And patient location is displayed on all devices:
      | Display Location      | Information Shown                          |
      | ED Dashboard          | ðŸš¨ CODE BLUE - BED ED-5 flashing red     |
      | Mobile Devices        | Push notification with location           |
      | Overhead Displays     | "CODE BLUE BED ED-5" prominently shown   |
      | Pager System          | "CODE BLUE ED-5" message                  |
      | Hospital Information  | Alert on all connected terminals          |
    And the resuscitation documentation template opens automatically:
      | Documentation Section | Template Fields                            |
      | Event Details         | Time, location, discoverer, initial rhythm|

      | Vital Signs           | Real-time monitoring integration           |
      | Interventions         | CPR quality, airway management, IV access |

  Scenario: Code blue response with automatic equipment alerts
    Given a code blue has been activated in bed "ED-5"
    When the code blue alert is triggered
    Then emergency equipment alerts are automatically generated:
      | Equipment Type        | Alert Message                              |
      | Crash Cart            | Crash cart dispatch to ED-5               |
      | Defibrillator        | AED/Manual defibrillator to ED-5          |
      | Airway Equipment     | Intubation kit and ventilator to ED-5     |
      | Emergency Medications | Code blue medication box to ED-5          |
      | IV Access Supplies   | Central line kit and fluids to ED-5       |
    And equipment tracking is initiated:

      | Equipment Arrival     | Timestamp when equipment reaches bedside  |
    And backup equipment is automatically prepared:
      | Backup Equipment      | Preparation Action                         |
      | Secondary Crash Cart  | Made ready for potential second code       |
      | Additional Ventilator | Checked and moved closer to ED            |
      | Blood Bank Alert      | Emergency blood products prepared          |
      | OR Notification       | Operating room placed on standby          |

  Scenario: Real-time code blue documentation during resuscitation
    Given a code blue is in progress in bed "ED-5"
    And the resuscitation documentation template is open
    And "Dr. Smith" is the code team leader
    When resuscitation interventions are performed
    Then real-time documentation captures all activities:
      | Intervention Type     | Documentation Fields                       |
      | CPR Administration    | Start time, compression quality, provider  |

      | IV Access            | Location, size, number of attempts        |
    And timeline tracking maintains precise chronology:
      | Timeline Entry        | Automatic Capture                          |
      | Event Start           | 14:35:22 - Code blue activated            |
      | CPR Initiated         | 14:35:45 - CPR started by Nurse Johnson   |
      | Team Leader Arrival   | 14:36:15 - Dr. Smith assumes leadership   |

      | Defibrillation       | 14:38:45 - 200J biphasic shock delivered  |
    And quality metrics are tracked in real-time:
      | Quality Metric        | Real-time Monitoring                       |
      | Compression Depth     | CPR feedback device integration           |

  Scenario: Code blue with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
    Given a code blue has been in progress for 8 minutes
    And resuscitation efforts are ongoing with documentation active
    When the patient achieves return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
    And "Dr. Smith" confirms pulse and blood pressure of 110/70
    Then the system updates the code status:
      | Status Update         | Documentation Changes                      |
      | ROSC Achievement      | Time: 14:43:15 - ROSC achieved            |

      | Rhythm Change        | Normal sinus rhythm confirmed             |
      | Intervention Pause   | CPR discontinued, monitoring intensified  |
    And post-ROSC care protocols are activated:
      | Post-ROSC Protocol    | Automated Alerts                           |
      | ICU Transfer          | ICU bed request and transport coordination |

  Scenario: Unsuccessful code blue with transition to end-of-life care
    Given a code blue has been in progress for 25 minutes
    And multiple rounds of medications and defibrillation have been attempted
    And no return of spontaneous circulation has been achieved
    When "Dr. Smith" as code team leader determines resuscitation efforts should cease
    And the time of death is called at 15:00:15
    Then the system handles end-of-life documentation:
      | End-of-Life Process   | Documentation Requirements                 |
      | Time of Death         | 15:00:15 - Officially recorded           |

  Scenario: Code blue during visitor hours with family present
    Given it is 19:30 during evening visitor hours
    And the patient's family members are at bedside when cardiac arrest occurs
    When the code blue is activated
    Then family management protocols are immediately implemented:
      | Family Management     | Immediate Actions                          |
      | Family Escort         | Security escorts family to private area    |
