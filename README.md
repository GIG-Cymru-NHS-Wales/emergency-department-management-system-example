# Emergency department management system example

This repository is a public free open source demonstration of how to plan an
emergency department management system, from higher-level use cases to
lower-level test automation.

All of the information here is synthetic, and generated by Claude AI, and for
educational purposes. This is not a real emergency department management system.

## Business use cases

**Prompt: business use cases for emergency department management system.**

A hospital emergency department management system serves multiple critical
functions to improve patient care, operational efficiency, and resource
utilization. Here are the key use cases.

### Patient Flow Management

The system tracks patients from arrival through discharge, managing triage
queues and bed assignments. It provides real-time visibility into patient
locations, wait times, and treatment status, helping staff optimize patient flow
and reduce bottlenecks. Emergency departments can monitor capacity in real-time
and implement surge protocols when needed.

### Triage and Prioritization

Clinical staff use the system to assess patient acuity levels and assign
priority scores based on standardized protocols like ESI (Emergency Severity
Index). The system can automatically queue patients by priority, ensuring
critical cases receive immediate attention while managing less urgent cases
efficiently.

### Resource Allocation

The system helps coordinate staffing schedules, equipment availability, and room
assignments. It can track which medical equipment is in use, available, or
requires maintenance, and optimize allocation of beds, stretchers, and
specialized treatment areas based on current demand and patient needs.

### Clinical Documentation

Healthcare providers document patient assessments, treatment plans, medications
administered, and procedure notes directly in the system. This creates a
comprehensive medical record that's immediately accessible to all authorized
care team members and integrates with the hospital's broader electronic health
record system.

### Communication and Coordination

The system facilitates communication between different departments, from
radiology and laboratory services to pharmacy and social services. It can
automatically notify relevant departments when orders are placed and track
completion status, reducing delays in patient care.

### Compliance and Reporting

Emergency departments must meet various regulatory requirements and quality
metrics. The system generates reports on patient wait times, treatment outcomes,
medication administration, and other key performance indicators needed for
accreditation bodies like The Joint Commission.

### Billing and Revenue Cycle

The system captures all billable services, procedures, and supplies used during
patient care. It ensures proper coding for insurance claims and tracks patient
financial responsibility, helping optimize revenue while maintaining accurate
billing practices.

### Disaster and Mass Casualty Response

During emergencies, the system can activate special protocols for mass casualty
events, track surge capacity, and coordinate with external emergency services.
It helps manage resource allocation during high-volume incidents and maintains
continuity of care.

## Programming use cases

**Prompt: programming use cases for emergency department management system.**

Here are the key programming use cases for developing an emergency department
management system. These programming challenges require expertise in healthcare
informatics, real-time systems, database design, API development, and security
implementation to create a robust and reliable emergency department management
platform.

### Patient Registration and Admission

Programming workflows for patient check-in, insurance verification, and
demographic data capture. The system needs to handle walk-ins, ambulance
arrivals, and transfers from other facilities. Integration with health
information exchanges (HIE) to retrieve existing patient records and avoid
duplicate registrations.

### Real-Time Dashboard Development

Creating dynamic dashboards that display current ED status, patient counts by
triage level, bed availability, and staff assignments. Programming automated
refresh mechanisms and alert systems for capacity thresholds, critical patient
status changes, and equipment failures.

### Triage Algorithm Implementation

Coding standardized triage protocols (ESI, CTAS, MTS) with decision trees and
scoring algorithms. Programming interfaces for nurses to input vital signs,
chief complaints, and assessment data that automatically calculate acuity scores
and queue positioning.

### Queue Management Systems

Developing algorithms for patient queuing based on acuity, arrival time, and
resource availability. Programming dynamic reordering capabilities when patient
conditions change and implementing fair queuing mechanisms that prevent
lower-acuity patients from waiting indefinitely.

### Electronic Health Record Integration

Building APIs and data exchange protocols to connect with hospital EHR systems,
laboratory information systems (LIS), radiology information systems (RIS), and
pharmacy systems. Programming HL7 FHIR interfaces for seamless data sharing
across healthcare systems.

### Clinical Decision Support

Programming rule engines for medication interaction checks, allergy alerts, and
protocol-based care recommendations. Implementing evidence-based guidelines for
common ED presentations like chest pain, sepsis screening, and stroke protocols.

### Resource Tracking and Allocation

Developing systems to monitor bed occupancy, equipment availability, and staff
assignments in real-time. Programming automated notifications when resources
become available and algorithms for optimal resource allocation based on patient
acuity and departmental needs.

### Workflow Automation

Creating automated workflows for order entry, result notification, and discharge
processes. Programming interfaces for barcode scanning of medications and
supplies, automated charging for billable items, and integration with nurse call
systems.

### Reporting and Analytics

Building data warehouses and programming complex queries for performance
metrics, quality indicators, and regulatory reporting. Developing predictive
analytics for patient volume forecasting, length of stay estimation, and
resource planning.

### Mobile Application Development

Programming mobile apps for physicians and nurses to access patient information,
enter orders, and receive alerts while moving throughout the department.
Implementing secure authentication and real-time synchronization with the main
system.

### Interoperability and Standards

Programming compliance with healthcare standards like HL7, DICOM for medical
imaging, and ICD-10 for diagnosis coding. Developing APIs for third-party
integrations with ambulance services, other hospitals, and public health
reporting systems.

### Security and Audit Systems

Implementing robust authentication, authorization, and encryption systems to
protect patient data. Programming comprehensive audit trails that track all
system access and data modifications for HIPAA compliance and security
monitoring.

### Performance Optimization

Programming database optimization for high-transaction environments,
implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data, and developing
load balancing solutions to handle peak usage periods during emergencies or
system outages.

### Notification and Alert Systems

Developing multi-channel notification systems (email, SMS, pager, in-app) for
critical alerts, lab results, and workflow updates. Programming escalation
protocols for time-sensitive notifications and customizable alert preferences
for different user roles.

## User stories

**Prompt: user stories for emergency department management system: given, when, then.**

Here are user stories for an emergency department management system using the
Given-When-Then format. These user stories cover the core functionality needed
for an emergency department management system, ensuring comprehensive workflow
coverage from patient arrival through discharge.

### Patient Registration

**Story 1: Walk-in Patient Registration:**

* **Given** a new patient arrives at the ED without prior registration
